# Coding The News Week 1 Homework

This is the second of three public repositories I will be publishing for this week's homework. 

## This is Part 2

Please see the other two Week 1 Homework repositories to view the complete assignment.

In this repository, I have built a simple cup game for users.

As my JS knowledge is limited, I used help from Claude to walk me through basic JS steps to randomly shuffle cup.png images. The script uses the Fisher-Yates shuffle to perform this task.

## Fisher-Yates Shuffle

The Fisher-Yates shuffle "is a popular algorithm used to randomize the order of elements in an array," writes Github user JDSherbert.

The FY shuffle essentially applies a number to each element of the array (or list of shuffled items) and then swaps the last element with another element based on the index number difference between the two. The two swapped elements are "n" and "k".
